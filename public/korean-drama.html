<h2>Why Am I Writing This?</h2>
<p>
  As an avid K-drama watcher I've watched many shows, but I have liked none as
  much as Itaewon Class. My very first watch-through, I, to this day, can still
  rememeber the electrical feeling I got from watching an episode. As many of
  you know, Kdramas are famous for ending their episodes on cliff-hangers. No
  cliff-hangers were as intense and had me desperate to see what was to happen
  next as much as this show. I've watched this show maybe 3-4 times now, and I
  want to use this page as a way to express my thoughts.

<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>
  Rating: 10/10 <br />
  My Thoughts: Not everyone is going to love the show. I would be lying if I
  said the love aspect of the show was anything better than mediocre. Yet, in
  the one aspect that the show lacks, the infinite number of other aspects of
  the show compensates for. The overall plot of the show is really exciting: a
  unique revenge story. The visual effects were nothing less of gorgeous. The
  acting was superb. The symbolism was easy to overlook, but both creative and
  amazing. I could go on, but I'm going to stop here. I just one to add one more
  thought. To me the show was super exciting. Objectively it's not the best
  Kdrama out there but the excitement that was stirred within me as I progressed
  through this show was so strong that I have been inspired to seek a career in
  acting. I want to recreate that same sense of excitement for the show's
  viewers. I want to create that level of impact for the viewers.
